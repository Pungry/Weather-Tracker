This is the Weather Tracker, an app that tells you the current weather and 5-day forecast of any city you search. Use the search bar in the upper-left part of the page to search any city you'd like. The right side of the page will then populate with that city's current weather and five-day forecast. The website connects to OpenWeatherAPI for its up-to-date weather tracking. Once you've made a search, that result will be saved as a button on the left side of the page under the "Saved Searches" tab. Clicking on one of these buttons will immediately re-search the weather information for the city on the button. If you close the tab, the most recent search information will populate the page upon re-opening. The app is deployed at:
